Hi! I am Liu Run, a PhD student at [the School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.ucas.ac.cn/index.php/zh-cn/), [UCAS](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/).

I am deeply passionate about exploring diverse fields related to `Communications`, `Networks`, and `Artificial Intelligence`, with a strong commitment to advancing my skills and understanding of emerging technologies.

Recently, I am particularly interested in <i><b>resource allocation in service deployment</b></i>, such as optimizing computational and network resources in edge computing systems.
